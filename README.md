> Switzerland is an experiment in the realm of Web Components through the use of native browser features with a [~4kb core](https://github.com/Wildhoney/Switzerland/blob/master/src/switzerland.js). Use [middleware](https://github.com/Wildhoney/Switzerland/tree/master/src/middleware) to apply behaviours to your components, such as [setState/state](https://github.com/Wildhoney/Switzerland/blob/master/src/middleware/state.js), [Redux](https://github.com/Wildhoney/Switzerland/blob/master/src/middleware/redux.js), mobx. Built with interoperability in mind using Custom Elements, allowing components to be embedded into React, Vue, Angular apps with ease. Style encapsulation by default using Shadow DOM.
